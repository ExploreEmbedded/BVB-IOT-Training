# BVB-IOT-Training

Notes:
1. EE server has been used for demo. Recommend you to spin your own server or use publically available free services like Sparkfun phant, Adafruit IO, AWS IOT etc
2. Since the code depends on various libraries, add them to the project before trying to compile the code.
3. Credentials for WiFi network, server etc need to be modified in the WiFi Code.
