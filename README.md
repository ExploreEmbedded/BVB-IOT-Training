# BVB-IOT-Training

Notes:
* EE server has been used for demo. Recommend you to spin your own server or use publically available free services like Sparkfun phant, Adafruit IO, AWS IOT etc.
* Since the code depends on various libraries, add them to the project before trying to compile the code.
* Credentials for WiFi network, server etc need to be modified in the WiFi Code.
